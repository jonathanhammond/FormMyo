The Myo enables the user to control technology wirelessly using various hand motions. It uses a set of electromyographic (EMG) sensors that sense electrical activity in the forearm muscles, combined with a gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer to recognize gestures.[1] The Myo can be used to control video games, presentations, music and visual entertainment. It differs from the Leap Motion device as it is worn rather than a 3D array of cameras that sense motion in the environment.[2]";
